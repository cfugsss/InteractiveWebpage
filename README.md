# InteractiveWebpage
This web page created with Folium creates markers for volcanoes in North America and dynamically colors each country depending on its population.

# Description

This web page created using folium uses data framed with pandas to create interactive markers for volcanoes in North America and displays their name. It also 
uses json data to create polygons around each country and color them depending on their population. The population data used was based on 2005 so its old but 
this was my first time using folium so it was all for educational purposes. Overall it was a good learning experience however I dont think ill come back and try to
make this better, I will most likely use folium going in a different direction leaving volcanoes behind and use its functionality to make something more useful.
